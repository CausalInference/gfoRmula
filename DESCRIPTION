Description: Implements the non-iterative conditional expectation (NICE) 
    algorithm of the g-formula algorithm (Robins (1986) 
    <doi:10.1016/0270-0255(86)90088-6>, Hernán and Robins (2024, ISBN:9781420076165)). 
    The g-formula can estimate an outcome's counterfactual mean or risk under 
    hypothetical treatment strategies (interventions) when there is sufficient 
    information on time-varying treatments and confounders. 
    This package can be used for discrete or continuous time-varying treatments 
    and for failure time outcomes or continuous/binary end of follow-up 
    outcomes. The package can handle a random measurement/visit process and a 
    priori knowledge of the data structure, as well as censoring (e.g., by loss 
    to follow-up) and two options for handling competing events for failure time
    outcomes. Interventions can be flexibly specified, both as interventions on 
    a single treatment or as joint interventions on multiple treatments.
    See McGrath et al. (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.patter.2020.100008> for a guide on 
    how to use the package.
