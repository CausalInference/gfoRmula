Description: Implements the parametric g-formula algorithm of Robins (1986) 
    <doi:10.1016/0270-0255(86)90088-6>. The g-formula can be used to estimate 
    the causal effects of hypothetical time-varying treatment interventions on 
    the mean or risk of an outcome from longitudinal data with time-varying 
    confounding. This package allows: 1) binary or continuous/multi-level 
    time-varying treatments; 2) different types of outcomes (survival or 
    continuous/binary end of follow-up); 3) data with competing events or 
    truncation by death and loss to follow-up and other types of censoring 
    events; 4) different options for handling competing events in the case of 
    survival outcomes; 5) a random measurement/visit process; 6) joint 
    interventions on multiple treatments; and 7) general incorporation of a 
    priori knowledge of the data structure.
