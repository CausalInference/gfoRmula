## Package Updates

### Changes in Version 0.3.0 (TBD)
*  Added wrapper function called `gformula()` for the `gformula_survival()`, `gformula_continuous_eof()`, and `gformula_binary_eof()` functions. Users should now use the more general `gformula()` function to apply the g-formula.
*  Added option for users to specify the values for lags at pre-baseline times by including rows at time t = -1, t = -2, ..., t = -i.
*  Added option for users to pass in "control parameters" (e.g., maximum number of iterations, maxit, in glm.control) when fitting models for time-varying covariates via the `covparams$control` argument. (Thanks to @jerzEG for the suggestion)
*  Added simulated data under the natural course to the `sim_data` component of the output of the `gformula()` function
*  Added a progress bar for the number of bootstrap samples completed. See the `show_progress` argument of the `gformula()` function for further details
*  Fixed minor bug in the `lagavg()` function
*  Fixed bug occuring when not using lags of the intervention variable(s)
*  Fixed bug occuring in the truncation beyond covariate ranges. (Thanks to Louisa Smith)
*  Updates to the documentation

### Changes in Version 0.2.1 (2019-08-24)
*  First version released on CRAN
   ([https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gfoRmula/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gfoRmula/index.html)) 
*  Updates to the documentation

### Changes in Version 0.2.0 (2019-08-22)
*  Removed `example_intervention1()`, `example_intervention2()`, and
   `visit_sum_orig()`, as these functions are not used internally and users
   should not directly apply them
*  Removed export of `visit_sum()` and `natural()`, as these functions are used
   internally and users should not directly apply them
*  Updates to the documentation

### Changes in Version 0.1.1 (2019-08-21)
*  Minor updates to the documentation
